# AI Infrastructure Log

Owner: [Redacted]
Environment Role: AI Experimentation Node
Classification: Private Infrastructure Documentation

# 1. Purpose

This document logs:

- Infrastructure decisions
- Security configuration
- Network architecture
- System changes
- Deployment structure
- Hardening steps
- Architectural evolution

This file intentionally excludes sensitive identifiers such as:
- Public IPs
- Private mesh IPs
- Hostnames
- Email addresses
- SSH fingerprints
- API keys
- Account IDs

---

# 2. System Overview

## Operating System
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Machine Role
Dedicated execution node for:
- AI agents
- Automation systems
- Long-running compute processes
- API integrations
- Background services

Not used for personal productivity.

---

# 3. Network Architecture

## Network Type
Private mesh network

## Remote Access Method
SSH over encrypted private overlay network

## Exposure Model
- No direct public SSH exposure
- No inbound router port forwarding
- Access restricted to authenticated devices inside mesh

## Security Model
Zero-trust style access:
- Device-authenticated
- Encrypted
- No open ports exposed to internet

---

# 4. Access Configuration

## SSH Setup

- ed25519 key-based authentication enabled
- Password authentication disabled
- Root login disabled
- SSH service restarted and validated

## Authentication Model
Key-only authentication.

No password fallback.

# 5. Identity Segmentation

Separate operational identity created for:

- GitHub
- Email
- Infrastructure services

Purpose:
- Reduce blast radius
- Maintain operational separation
- Prevent credential contamination

---

# 6. Current Execution State

Infrastructure Layer: Complete  
Secure Remote Access: Complete  
Application Layer: Not yet provisioned  

Not yet implemented:

- Containerization
- Monitoring stack
- Backup system
- Logging aggregation
- Automated restart policies
- Resource governance limits

System currently acts as hardened base compute layer.

# 7. Security Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Disabled password SSH | Prevent brute force attack surface |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Enforced key authentication | Stronger access control |
| YYYY-MM-DD | No public exposure | Minimize attack surface |

---

# 8. Infrastructure Changes Log

## YYYY-MM-DD
- Initial OS installation
- Network mesh installed
- SSH hardened
- Access verified

## YYYY-MM-DD
- [Future changes go here]

---

# 9. Architectural Intent

This node functions as:

A controlled experimentation sandbox.

It is not a production revenue system.
It is not a public-facing service.
It is a secure execution engine.

Future evolution may include:

- Docker container isolation
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Monitoring stack
- Resource limiting
- Secrets management
- Deployment pipelines

---

# 10. Governance Principles

1. No public exposure without documented reason
2. Every new service logged in this file
3. Every open port documented
4. Every automation documented
5. No unmanaged long-running processes
6. No untracked credential storage

---

# 11. Pending Decisions

- Containerization approach
- Secret management strategy
- Backup strategy
- Monitoring stack selection
- Resource control policies

---

# 12. Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Credential leakage | Key-only SSH | Mitigated |
| Service sprawl | Logging policy | In progress |
| Resource exhaustion | Limits not yet configured | Open |
